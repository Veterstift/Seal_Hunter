------------------------------

Seal Hunter is a free 2D shoot 'em up game, this version is written and programmed by me from scratch with the only goal for it to be playable on the Nintendo Switch.
This game might trigger some people due to the content of seal hunting, but I want to make it clear that this game is not meant to promote or glorify seal hunting in any way.
The game is purely fictional and for entertainment and educational purposes only, feel free to download, use, alter and/or modify my source code as you see fit.

The concept of this game is to prevent the seals and other creatures from overpopulating the ocean and eating all the fish from it!
Using a wide range of weapons, players must prevent harmful sea creatures, ranging from seals to polar bears, from reaching back to the ocean to ensure a good catch.
The base game is divided into 5 levels, each with its own unique challenges and obstacles. 
later on I will be adding more functionalities like splitscreen Co-op and/or online Multiplayer, game modes such as endless survival mode or levels with different stages.
